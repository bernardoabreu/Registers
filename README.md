# Registers

## Description
A Sublime Text plugin that adds the option to save text and macros to registers for quick use.
There are 10 possible registers, defined by a number from 0 to 9.
The input text can be some selected text or the text currently in the clipboard.
Additonally, it's also possible to record the current native sublime macro in use into one of the registers, regardless of the content.
